## Controls & Compliance Checklist

### Identity and Access Management
- [ ] Enforce strong password policies
- [ ] Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- [x] Role-based access control (RBAC) implemented

### Data Protection
- [ ] Encrypt customer data at rest and in transit
- [ ] Implement GDPR rights (data access, deletion)
- [x] HTTPS enforced on all web pages

### Regulatory Compliance
- [ ] Maintain PCI DSS compliance checklist
- [ ] Assign a Data Protection Officer (DPO) for GDPR
